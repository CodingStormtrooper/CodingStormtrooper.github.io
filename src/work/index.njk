      <ul class="list-disc ml-5 mt-3 text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-300 space-y-2">
        <li>Built a management dashboard for weekly metrics and a "home base" view — open vs. closed cases (daily, weekly, monthly), oldest cases, with filters by component, account, and case owner.</li>
        <li>Created a board report for fast historical data access, enabling component and skillset breakdowns that surfaced client needs previously invisible to leadership.</li>
        <li>Designed a rep dashboard used daily to prioritize responses, order work, and manage queues more efficiently.</li>
        <li>Partnered with Salesforce admin to simplify case statuses from 29 down to 10, reducing friction for clients.</li>
        <li>Used the component data to make the escalation team client-facing and focus onboarding on the products that generate the most cases.</li>
        <li>Building onboarding playbooks per component so new hires ramp up on the same material.</li>

      <ul class="list-disc ml-5 mt-3 text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-300 space-y-2">
        <li>Rebuilt the tiered support structure (Tier 1–3) so there's clear ownership at each level and tickets don't stall.</li>
        <li>Designed and implemented a case age segmentation model (triage, midrange, long-tail) to improve prioritization and reduce backlog aging.</li>
        <li>Formalized Tier 3 (TSS-E) responsibilities and started cross-training the team on Zabbix monitoring, deployments, and system health. The goal was to get support working more like SRE.</li>
        <li>Made Root Cause Analysis (RCA) part of the Definition of Done, which meant Support, QA, and Engineering had to actually work together on fixes.</li>
        <li>Presented to the VP of Support on what was broken, what was working, and where we were headed.</li>

        <li>Started building triage automation with ChatGPT and Jira to sort and route tickets more accurately.</li>
        <li>Goal: reduce manual sorting overhead and get the right tickets to the right people faster, especially during high-volume periods.</li>
        <li>The idea is to automate the repetitive sorting without taking humans out of the decisions that matter.</li>
