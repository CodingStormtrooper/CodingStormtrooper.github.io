    <p>I'm Allysha, a Technical Support Engineering Manager in Kansas City. I spend most of my time making support teams work better with engineering — building triage systems, fixing processes, and figuring out where the handoffs keep breaking.</p>
    <p>I like taking messy systems and making them make sense, and turning chaotic processes into something repeatable. Whether it's designing case segmentation models at work, routing DNS through encrypted tunnels in my home lab, or building proxy servers to learn Node.js — I like understanding how things work end to end.</p>
    <p>Outside of work, I'm usually tinkering with my Raspberry Pi setup, experimenting in the kitchen, or down a rabbit hole learning something new. Current interests include AI automation, cloud infrastructure, and whatever my cat will let me get away with.</p>
