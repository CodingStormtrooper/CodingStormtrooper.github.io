    <p>I'm Allysha — a Technical Support Engineering Manager based in Kansas City. I lead teams through operational modernization, building triage systems and closing the gap between Support and Engineering.</p>
    <p>I'm driven by making complex systems understandable and chaotic processes repeatable. Whether it's designing case segmentation models at work, routing DNS through encrypted tunnels in my home lab, or building proxy servers to learn Node.js — I like understanding how things work end to end.</p>
    <p>Outside of work, I'm usually tinkering with my Raspberry Pi setup, experimenting in the kitchen, or down a rabbit hole learning something new. Current interests include AI automation, cloud infrastructure, and whatever my cat will let me get away with.</p>
